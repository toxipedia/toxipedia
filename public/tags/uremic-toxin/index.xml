      <description>Alternative Names L-Homocitrulline
N6-carbamoyl-L-lysine
N6-(aminocarbonyl)-L-lysine
Classification Polar
Water soluble uremic toxin
Molecular Information Weight: 131.17 [1]
Formula: C6H13N3O3 [1]
Classification: amino acid [3]
General Information L-Homocitrulline is an amino acid and a metabolite of [ornithine] in mammalian (including human) metabolism. The amino acid can be detected in larger amounts in the [urine] of individuals with [urea] cycle disorders. At present, it is thought that the depletion of the [ornithine] supply causes the accumulation of carbamyl-phosphate in the urea cycle which may be responsible for the enhanced synthesis of homocitrulline and [homoarginine].</description>

      <guid>https://toxipedia.github.io/hydroquinone_sulfate/</guid>
      <description>Alternative Names Benzene-1,4-diol Sulfate
1,4-Dihydroxybenzene sulfate
p-Hydroquinone sulfate
Molecular Information Weight: 202.20 [1]
Formula: C6H6O4S [1]
Classification: water-soluble phenolic compound and solubilizer [3]
Origins Hydroquinone sulfate is not naturally formed in the body, but is derived from topical or oral administration of hydroquinone products. It can be found in the blood and urine after application or consumption of hydroquinone, and its levels can be used to monitor the usage of hydroquinone in the body.</description>

      <description>Alternative Names Trimethyl uric acid
8-oxy-caffeine
caffeol
Molecular Information Weight: 210.19 [1]
Formula: C8H10N4O3 [1]
Classification: water-soluble uremic toxin [3]
General information Trimethyluric acid is a methyl derivative of uric acid, found occasionally in human urine [2]. It is a metabolite of caffeine [1].
1,3,7-trimethylurate (TMU) is a uremic toxin that is produced by the metabolism of caffeine and theophylline in the liver. It is typically excreted in the urine, but in patients with kidney dysfunction or failure, TMU can accumulate in the bloodstream and cause toxic effects on various organ systems.</description>
