Origins
-------------------
>Hydroquinone sulfate is not naturally formed in the body, but is derived from topical or oral administration of hydroquinone products. It can be found in the blood and urine after application or consumption of hydroquinone, and its levels can be used to monitor the usage of hydroquinone in the body. However, it is important to note that the presence of hydroquinone sulfate in the body does not necessarily indicate its safety, as long-term exposure to high levels of hydroquinone has been linked to potential toxicity.

General information
-------------------

> Hydroquinone sulfate is a sulfate ester of hydroquinone, a phenolic compound. It is used as a solubilizer in various cosmetic and personal care products \[[2](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/p-hydroquinone)\].

Clinical Implications
