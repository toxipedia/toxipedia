> L-homocitrulline is a L-lysine derivative that is L-lysine having a carbamoyl group at
the N(6)-position. It is found in individuals with urea cycle disorders.
Homocitrulline is a one of the products of protein carbamylation is which is formed
by binding isocyanic acid to the ε-NH2 group of the side chain of lysine residues \[[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27302313/)\].

General information
-------------------

> L-Homocitrulline is a non-proteinogenic amino acid and an intermediate in the urea cycle \[[2](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0002123)\]. It is produced as a result of protein breakdown in the body by the enzyme argininosuccinate. It is typically cleared by the kidneys, but in patients with kidney dysfunction or failure, L-Homocitrulline can accumulate in the bloodstream and cause toxic effects on various organ systems. \[[1](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/L-Homocitrulline)\].  



Clinical Implications
-------------------

*L-Homocitrulline has been associated with the following diseases:*  
> Erectile dysfunction  
> Cardiovascular disease  

> Homocitrulline is an important biomarker in patients with uremia and its increase in
concentration allows distinguishing acute from chronic renal failure and is a risk
factor of mortality.
> High levels of L-Homocitrulline have been associated with cardiovascular disease
and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Rheumatoid
arthritis (RA).
In addition, L-Homocitrulline can react with other uremic toxins to form advanced
glycation end-products (AGEs), which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage.
Therefore, L-Homocitrulline is an important biomarker for the assessment of kidney
function and for the evaluation of the risk of various chronic diseases
