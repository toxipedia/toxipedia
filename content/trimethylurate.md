## General information

> Trimethyluric acid is a methyl derivative of uric acid, found occasionally in human urine \[[2](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0002123)\]. It is a metabolite of caffeine \[[1](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1_3_7-Trimethyluric-acid)\].

> 1,3,7-trimethylurate (TMU) is a uremic toxin that is produced by the metabolism of caffeine and theophylline in the liver. It is typically excreted in the urine, but in patients with kidney dysfunction or failure, TMU can accumulate in the bloodstream and cause toxic effects on various organ systems. High levels of TMU have been associated with cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and bone disease. In addition, TMU has been shown to inhibit the activity of certain enzymes in the liver, which can lead to the accumulation of other uremic toxins. Therefore, TMU is an important biomarker for the assessment of kidney function and for the evaluation of the risk of various chronic diseases.
